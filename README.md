# Flaskr Webservice with Database


This web service was developed using flaskr. A basic tutorial can be found 
[here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/tutorial/introduction/).
It can be run on Windows with the "run.bat" file or run on Unix-based systems 
with the "run.sh" file, but some changes may need to be made in order to
accomodate for the working directory of the project.
This project uses a basic SQL database in order to
create a website which allows the user to make
a blog-like application after logging in with
the default username and password ("admin" and
"default" respectively) and posting a subject and message using a form.
 However, in the future the plan is to design a more unique, useful
back-end service to a speech recognition software 
by sending/ receiving strings. The flaskr application allows 
for a more simple web development experience since it has a wide range 
of support for tools such as [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/).
