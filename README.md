# Flaskr Webservice with Database


This web service is based which can be found [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/tutorial/introduction/).
It can be run on Windows with the "run.bat" file,
but some changes may need to be made in order to
accomodate for the working directory of the project.
This project uses a basic SQL database in order to
create a website which allows the user to create
a blog-like application after logging in with
the default username and password ("admin" and
"default" respectively). However, in the future,
the plan is to design a more unique, useful
back-end service to a speech recognition
software by sending/ receiving strings.
